MVP
***What is the purpose of an MVP and why is it important?
	MVP helps software engineers facilitate the development process. And this is one of the reasons why MVP is important. The product is then 		tested on the market to see if it has the potential to succeed.
	It is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount 	of effort.
	A company might choose to develop and release a minimum viable product because its product team wants to:
    * Release a product to the market as quickly as possible
    * Test an idea with real users before committing a large budget to the product’s full development
    * Learn what resonates with the company’s target market and what doesn’t
	In addition to allowing your company to validate an idea for a product without building the entire product, an MVP can also help minimize the time 	and resources you might otherwise commit to building a product that won’t succeed.

***What are the key components of an MVP and how can we prioritize the necessary features?
	The Key MVP elements
	An MVP must include these key elements in production quality:
    * Functionality – the set of features must deliver clear value to the user,
    * Design – the design of the MVP must be up to the highest industry standard,
    * Reliability – While early adopters are usually forgiving, you should have some production quality standard.
    * Usability – the MVP must be relatively easy to use and intuitive (you can assume early adopters will research and be technically savvy).

	The key components of a successful MVP:
	1. Identify the target audience: Identifying the right group of the target audience is the most essential strategy of a business. The features, which 	are considered for MVP, should be valuable to the end user. [1]
	2. Built for one person: A successful MVP should be built for one person. This means that it should be designed to solve a specific problem for a 	specific user. [2]
	3. Only essential features: Don't try to build an MVP with every possible feature included. Instead, build an MVP around the essentials. [3]
	4. Highly-skilled development company: If you can find a professional IT team as your backbone when building an MVP but it's not recommended 	you can use low code, no code solutions and automation to build your first product. [4]
	5. Focus on testing: A successful MVP should be focused on testing. This means that it should be designed to collect user feedback to make 		further integrations based on the needs of the target audience. [2]
		6. Small, contained launch: A successful MVP should have a small, contained launch. This means that it should be launched to a small group 	of early adopters to validate the product idea. [2]
	7. Be prepared to pivot: As you get feedback, be prepared to make changes to your product. [5]


	Make a list of MVP features and get it down to a minimum
	Define the steps a user will take when using your product. Create a list of features for every step. Then prioritize those features:
    * 		Choose one top feature for every step. Let’s call it the main feature that lets your users accomplish the main task of your app.
    * 		Get back to your list of features and divide them into two groups: high-priority and low-priority.
    * 		Now go back to the high-priority features. Complement every main feature with two more that a user might want to have in the app.
	MVP features and iterating based on real-world usage to increase your chances of long-term success.

        1. Define Your Unique Value Proposition (UVP): Identify features that set you apart from competitors. Showcase these unique features to attract users and make your product stand out.
        2. Identify Your Target Audience and Their Pain Points: Determine your primary customers, their needs, and how your product can help them. Focus on solving their problems and improving their lives.
        3. Evaluate Your Competitors: Analyze your competitors’ products and learn from their strengths and weaknesses. Use customer reviews and feedback to gain insights and ideas for improvement.
        4. Focus On The Needs Met Criteria: Identify the core parts and features indispensable to your product’s existence. Create a list of features and categorize them as “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.” Prioritize these foundational elements and build upon them.
        5. Create User Stories: Outline how users interact with your product. These stories should describe the end user’s problem and the actions they need to take to reach their goal. For instance, in the case of an e-commerce website, a user story could be: “As a customer, I want to browse the clothing site, choose an item, and make a purchase.”
        6. Consider Business Value, Complexity, and Timing: When defining the MVP scope, assess the cost and complexity of each feature and the time required to develop it. Prioritize features based on their impact and feasibility.
        7. Stay Within Budget: Consider the cost of each feature and exclude those that exceed your budget. Look for alternative solutions or ways to reduce costs without compromising the core functionality.
        8. Get it Validated from Your End Users: Seek validation from real users and prioritize their problems rather than their feature requests. Focus on delivering value and meeting their needs.

*** How can we create an effective MVP and gather valuable feedback on it?
	Creating an MVP happens in four stages:
	1\ Identify and evaluate the challenge
	Start with finding a challenge and defining your target audience. Learn about this audience and their actual problems through surveys and 		interviews
	2\Analyze existing competitors
	Do this if there are similar products on the market. To analyze competitors, use services like SimilarWeb. Set up an extension in your browser to 	get insights into a website’s monthly traffic, rank, location of users, etc.
	3\Make a list of MVP features and get it down to a minimum
	Define the steps a user will take when using your product. Create a list of features for every step. Then prioritize those features:
    * 		Choose one top feature for every step. Let’s call it the main feature that lets your users accomplish the main task of your app.
    * 		Get back to your list of features and divide them into two groups: high-priority and low-priority.
    * 		Now go back to the high-priority features. Complement every main feature with two more that a user might want to have in the app.
	4\Development, alpha, and beta testing
	Alpha testing is performed by employees of the organization working on the project. Beta testing is done by real users on your side, meaning that 	you need to collect a group of users before you start developing your app.

***What are the costs associated with developing an MVP for both developers and clients?
	if you want to create a minimal viable product yourself, the cost will be nominal. Although it appears to be a nice idea, it is not an ideal way to go 	about MVP app development.
	A typical cost of a mobile app MVP can range from $5,000 to $50,000. A lot would depend entirely on the complexity of the app idea, features, 	and design.
	The MVP cost is only one aspect of the equation; on-time delivery, quality, and UI also form critical factors.

	The minimum viable product cost can vary depending on various factors such as the complexity of your app, the development team you hire and 	the technology stack used. However, building an MVP can fall within the average cost bracket of $10,000 to $100,000 or more.

***How does the development process for an MVP differ from standard development?
	When creating your MVP, one of the most common technical obstacles is deciding which tools, platforms, or frameworks to use. It’s important to 	choose the tools that match your MVP scope, skills, budget, and timeline. Consider the scalability, compatibility, and maintainability of the tools 	you use. Examples of tools that can help you create your MVP faster and easier include no-code or low-code platforms such as Bubble or 		Webflow, pre-built templates or themes such as Bootstrap or WordPress, cloud services like AWS or Firebase, and APIs or SDKs like Stripe or 		Twilio.

***Are there certain projects that are better suited for an MVP, and is it challenging to create one for a specific project?
	Landing Page MVP
	A landing page MVP lets you test the product idea and can help you in deciding whether to build an initial version of the minimum viable product 	or a different version than the intended version is to be created. It lets interested users join a mailing list or simply lets them click to buy now.
	Email MVP
	Creation of an email takes less effort than it takes to build a product or even a feature. If you have existing customers, then you can begin by 		creating and sending emails manually to check if the response to the email is favorable. If you observe that users are reading the mail but are not 	clicking on call-to-action buttons then it can be concluded that the offered value proposition is not attractive

*** When is it appropriate to take an MVP to the next level, and what should the next steps be?
	In some cases, the MVP proves to not be viable. This happens if the product does not solve customers’ needs or pique their interest. If you cannot 	monetize your product because customers won’t pay for what you are offering, the idea won’t work. Your MVP has done its job. In this scenario, 		you can go back to the drawing board with the information you learned from customers during the MVP process. Hopefully, your MVP proved 	attractive to customers. If you’ve gathered feedback that shows customers are interested and that they will pay, it is time to move forward to the 	next step after MVP. This is usually the MMP.

***Should senior developers or junior/trainee developers be tasked with creating an MVP?

	junior can creating an MVP . But along the way they are sure to face issues. If they are resilient they can surely overcome them, and eventually 	become better developers.
