Geolocation API

The Geolocation API is a powerful feature provided by modern web browsers that allows developers 
to retrieve the geographical location information of a user's device. It enables web applications to access the latitude and longitude coordinates, 
as well as other related data such as altitude, speed, and heading.

How it Works

The Geolocation API utilizes various methods to determine the user's location. 
It typically relies on a combination of GPS (Global Positioning System), 
Wi-Fi network information, cellular network information, 
and IP address to provide accurate location data.

When a web application requests the user's location, 
the browser prompts the user for permission to share their location information. Once the user grants permission, 
the browser uses the available sources to estimate the device's location.
