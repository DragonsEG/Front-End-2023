## Introduction
In the following sections I'm trying to illustrate the core values and key take aways while building an MVP project.

<mark>All highlighted sections like this one (^^) is personal opinions you may or may not take it for considration</mark>

First let's get familliar with the concept of MVP it stands for **A minimum viable product**

It is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and provide early quality feedback

---
## The purpose of an MVP and why is it important?
The purpose of MVP is testing the core feature of the product with early adopters and Launch a working product to market before a compatitors

#### the importance of MVP
- Avoid building something not helpful every one thinks his ideas will change the world and become the next _steve jobs_ but in fact our products and ideas may not sell and the final goal is the profit <sup>most of the time</sup>

- Help you to understand your own product values and what it's weak points to early refine your project <mark>most of MVP projects is far different from what was expected in early stages.</mark>
---
## The key components of an MVP and how can we prioritize the necessary features
<mark>Building an MVP leads a great vlaue to the business it reduces the complexity create a simple product and build over it and reduce the time for lunching a product to the market</mark>

#### prioritize the necessary features
*devide your features into four sections*
1- must have: features must have to make the product work
2- should have: features that have a great value to your product
3- nice to have: if we add some of ...(okay work on it after launching your product)
4- can be done; (do if finished all other critical parts <mark>critical parts never end</mark>)

**Lunch Your product with Must have features**

---
## Effective MVP and gather valuable feedback
Effictive MVP has no difference of any other effictive project, any project that drive value and solve a problem is an effictive project
#### feedback
<mark>once you create a product that solve a problem you are going to find a ton of peoble that want to have access to early releases</mark>
- try your previous customers if you have lunched othe products
- use social platforms like dribble, youtube 
- <mark>you can even pay an influencer to promote your product on his mailing list</mark>
---

## Costs associated with developing an MVP for both developers and clients

- the cost of hardware and maintanance from developers side
- for the clint they are some time charged for the product that doesn't match their requirements <mark>most of the softwares have a free trials so the user have the time to make up his dessision.</mark>

<mark>Costs can be minamized to 0$ but the acctual cost of time working and mentainance the project and for clints is time and frustration while using a project that have some issues or not be working as expected</mark>

---

## Development process for an MVP differ from standard development 
<mark>MVP workes like normal development process but MVP is a continous cycles of the normal development</mark>

---


## projects that are better suited for an MVP, and is it challenging to create one for a specific project
<mark>Every project could be an MVP project</mark>
The challenging for creating MVP project is the fear of loasing a potential client which might happen because the boor functionality during early releases
And the cure for that fear occures when relizing if the custommer have a better alternative he wouldn't be using our product now so the custommer will come back after while to inroll into the cycle of using your product leave a feed back 
and even appreciate the updates

---
## Using third-party services when creating an MVP
<mark>It's opvios that using a third party services will inhance your product development time and maintainance, using the right third party service is legal and some times prefable while building projects</mark>

---
## Taking the MVP to the next level, and what should the next steps be
Taking the MVP to the next step aftter testing and gathering feedback, every thing is working just fine, and our clints welling to pay fo ower sevices
**the next step** is okay lets take it to the next level lets build over the project launch it to the market which called **_MMB_** _(Minimum Marketable Product)_

---
## Can an MVP be utilized for projects of any size, and is there a recommended timeframe for feature releases following the MVP
<mark>MVP can be utilized to any project size but for small projects building MVP is like muddling arround if it's just fine to finish it in a couple of month just do it, for bigger projects release time framing usualy depends on the complixity of the project features but if it's so complex or have a lot of features just launch in a mounth or even earlier times and engaging your user will make you keep on and may be a simple message for your users like 'We are working on this project to make your life easier we appresiate your time of using it and we hope we could use feedback to make your experience easier'</mark>

---
## Should senior developers or junior/trainee developers be tasked with creating an MVP?

Short story long Any one could work on MVP
<mark>the operation of continous building is a greet helpful for juniors to sharpen there skills</mark>
